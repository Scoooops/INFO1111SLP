Hello,  
This will be my submission for my level 1 artifact - my Jira domain.  
Since access to the domain requires an Atlassian account, I will be presenting my artifact through a series of photos instead (although I will link the domain down below in case you would like to follow along).
Please refer to the pdf document titled “Level 1 Artifact” to see the photos and description of my Level 1 artifact.
