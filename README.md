# INFO1111 Self Learning Project
\
A whole semester project in which I taught myself the use of Jira, and to a lesser extent, Confluence. My progress was recorded in two separate reports.\
\
Report 1 was an introductory level of knowledge of Jira, and report 2 was for a more advanced knowledge of both Jira and Confluence.
